Quan_laws_2;Status of Council of Clans;;;;;;;;;;x

Quan_laws_3;Army Law;;;;;;;;;;x
Quan_laws_3_desc;Traditionally, each clan of the Golden Steppe gives a portion of their warriors to the ruler of Quan, but the influx of Jian colonists inspired the princes of Quan to use these warriors as either a primary force or an elite force whose members are handpicked by the ruler.;;;;;;;;;;x
