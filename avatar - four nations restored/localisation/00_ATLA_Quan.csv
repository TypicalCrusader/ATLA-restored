Quan_laws_3;Army Law;;;;;;;;;;x
Quan_laws_3_desc;Traditionally, each clan of the Golden Steppe gives a portion of their warriors to the ruler of Quan, but the influx of Jian colonists inspired the princes of Quan to use these warriors as either a primary force or an elite force whose members are handpicked by the ruler.;;;;;;;;;;x

#Pre Revolt narrative Event
QuanPreRevoltEvtTit;Whispers in the Shadows;;;;;;;;;;x
QuanPreRevoltEvtDesc;Under the cover of darkness, the clan leaders of Gonzun, Bei, Guan, Dong, and Yi, gather to discuss their impending insurrection. Over heated debate, they recant the perversions of justice they have suffered -- tyranny from their lord, and taxes so brutal their people can barely afford food. Hearing enough, one lord speaks up to rally the others, promising their master's cruel reign to be over. Declaring themselves the "Rebellion of Five Banners", they draw up plans to start their righteous uprising on the 12th of the Fifth Moon, next year.\nMeanwhile in Quan the Capital of Dongfang...\nAs you settle in for a night of work, one of your advisors enters your chambers with troubling news. "We have not received tribute from any of the clans, my liege. Surely, if this was just one bad actor, the others would still pay their taxes, but since none of them paid, we're worried they're working together against us." A scowl breaks across your face, and the advisor takes note, following with "However... the Steppes these days are rather dangerous, so it's possible they are simply late". A naive thought, at best, and much wiser to take action. "Increase patrols and prepare provisions, in-case the clans try something foolish", you bark, before the advisor hastily bows and leaves.;;;;;;;;;;x
