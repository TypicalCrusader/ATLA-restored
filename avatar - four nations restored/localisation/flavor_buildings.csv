avatar_mansion_1;Ruined Avatar Mansion;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
avatar_mansion_1_desc;Built by Earth Sage Jianzhu to house the legendary Avatar. The mansion was designed almost as a miniature city. The compound is massive in size, with ornate high walls as its perimeter and great halls peppered with design elements of the four nations to house both books and people alike. However, most of the mansion lay in ruin after multiple battles, and has been abandoned for many years. Even so, its splendor still amazes many that come to the Island, and can be rebuilt to serve once more as a residence of the ruler of Kyoshi island.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

Many of the shortcomings of the original mansion have been addressed, with an additional guard barracks for the security of the palace, as well as a greatly improved servants quarter, library, and garden to match. Even the richest dignitary may look in jealous eyes as the people of Kyoshi Island take awe to its renewed prescence and take pride in its splendor.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
