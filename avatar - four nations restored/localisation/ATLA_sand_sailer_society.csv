EVTOPTA_SANDR.40;Let's race.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.50;I won't commit to this just yet.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.300;[Root.GetFirstName], we would be honored to have you join the Sand Sailer Racers. However, to join you must win a exhibition race against another new racer.;

#########################RACE PRACTICE QUEST############################################


EVTDESC_SANDR.1010;[Root.GetFirstName], you and I know as well as anyone else in the club that practice makes perfect. You should hit the dunes sometime and improve your skills. Not saying you're a bad sailor or anything... Practice makes perfect though, right?;
EVTDESC_SANDR_1013;Dear [Root.GetFirstName], congratulations on completing your personal training. I hope the past few months have been very benefical to you.;
EVTOPT_SANDR_1013;And benefical it was...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1020;You climb aboard your trusty sand sailer and venture into the great Si Wong Desert. Beforehand, you planned out all the exercises and routines you will do, now all that needs to be done is proper execution of said exercises and routines.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1020;Let's get to work.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1022;It has been a few exhausting weeks since you began your practice session. While speeding along the desert on your sand sailer, working on your turns and stops and speed ups under the hot sun you decide to practice a maneuver. §RWhich maneuver do you select?§!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1022;Hairpin Turn.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1022;Overspeed.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1022;I should stick to the basics.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1023;I want to be the best sailor there ever was!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1023;Simply being a competent sailor will suffice for me.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1023;What was I thinking about agai-ZzZzZzZzZzZ;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1024;Your several month long practice session is soon coming to a close, and you decide one final grueling exercise is required. Most sand sailors go half the distance up the Si Wong Trail as a final exercise to their training sessions, but a bold few take the Old Si Wong Trail, a much longer and winding trail.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1024;I will take the Old Si Wong Trail!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1024;No need to kill myself out here.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1025;You executed that maneuver perfectly! With success like this, who could possibly stand in your way?;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1025;My practice to be the best continues.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1027;I'm sorry to hear about your injury while training, I wish you a speedy recovery [Root.GetFirstName].;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1027;I should be more careful next time...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1028;Everything happened so fast. One moment turns into the next and before you know it you are lying on the hot sand in the scorching sun. Also, you're in pain. A lot of pain. What went wrong?;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1028;Ouch!;
OUCH;You fail your maneuver, and by extension your quest. Perhaps when your martial is higher or your bending skills improve you'll have a better chance at success.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1050;After it is all said and done, you feel much improved in your bending and racing abilites. The decisions you made during your training session paid off.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1050;I feel much more stronger and healthy.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1050;I feel as if my bending has improved!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1051;After it is all said and done, you feel that you have improved in your bending and racing abilites. You feel as if you could've went a little harder but nonetheless, you are a better sand sailor than you once were.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1051;I need to rest.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1052;After it is all said and done, you feel as if you have fell short in your practice. You don't see yourself as a worse sailor compaired to when you started your session, but you don't feel improved.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1052;Not all is lost, as this still was a learning experience.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1023;You are sitting next to a small fire that you created deep in the Si Wong Desert. You are about halfway through your sand sailer practice. Night falls and you begin doze off, ready for sleep, but not before one final thought crosses your mind.;

##################MAINTAIN SAND SAILER LOC####################################
sand_quest_sailer;Maintain Sand Sailer;
sand_quest_sailer_desc;It is very important that a sandbender's sand sailer is maintained so it can preform at maximum efficency.;
sand_quest_sailer_tooltip;Use the §RMaintain Sand Sailer§! decision to begin this quest.;


EVTDESC_SANDR.1030;Dear [Root.GetFirstName], one of the most important things a sand sailer racer can do is maintain their sailer. Look after it, and it will look after you. Speaking of maintaining sailers, your's is looking a bit undermaintained. See to it that you fix your sailer.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1032;Word in the club is that [Root.GetFirstName] rides on a fast and nimble sailer. Good work [Root.GetFirstName].;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1032;Now it is time for my sailer to take care of me!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1035;After looking your sailer up and down, you deem it necessary to replace only one of the four crucial parts to a sand sailer. The question is now, what part to maintain?;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1035;The wooden frame.;
WOOD_CHAIN;The wood frame is very crucial to a sailer. Racing sailers are smaller and more nimble than the average sailer that roams the dunes and wood is scarce in the desert, but you come up with two good ideas.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1035;The rope rigging.;
ROPE_CHAIN;A very underlooked piece of hardware is the rope rigging used to rig the sail to the mast. How else is the sail supposed to stay on the mast? You decide this could be the easiest, but least rewarding part to pursue.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1035;The sail.;
SAIL_CHAIN;You notice there are several holes of various small sizes in your sail. You could replace it, and it shouldn't be too hard to do that.;
EVTOPTD_SANDR.1035;The Compass;
COMPASS_CHAIN;All sand sailers need a compass. Though they aren't needed for race purposes, you notice that your compass doesn't even work. Should you replace it?;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1036;You decide to replace the wooden frame of your sailer. You come up with two options on where to go. Misty Palms Oasis where you should have a wide varity of options, with varying prices. Or you can head into the local tribal settlement and see what you can find. The people there would love to their §Blord§! buy local!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1036;I'll head to Misty Palms and try my luck.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1036;I'll stay local.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1037;There is no place quite like Misty Palms. Between the shady inns and even shadier locals hanging out in the alleyways you can't help but feel at home here. As you enter the town you ask a local woman for directions to the marketplace.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1037;Let's hope this place has the parts I require.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1038;As you peruse the marketplace you finally find a sand sailer shop, tucked away in the back corner of the market. The prices are well... are not free but you decide it is what it is. As you consider the prices a shady voice calls out from an alleyway to your left, "You're [Root.GetTitledFirstName] right? If you need something fast and free, me and my boys are here for you!";
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1038;I take the high road and buy a frame with gold!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1038;My coffers aren't full right now, but I have some prestige to spare!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1039;Before you lay three options for a wood frame. A high quality frame for 100 gold, a moderate frame for 50 and a cheap frame for 25 gold.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1039;I require the best!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1039;This will suffice.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1039;Money is tight right now.;
EVTOPTD_SANDR.1039;Those shady men are still standing there, menacingly...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1040;"Whatever you need in this town [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is yours, as long as you go through me and my boys here!" The assumed leader of the theives says. You cannot even comprehend how they will steal an entire sailer frame, but you figure this cannot be their first time doing so.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1040;Steal the good looking one!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1040;Get me that one!;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1040;Get me... uh... that one...;
EVTOPTD_SANDR.1040;I am a [Root.GetTitle]! I should not be doing this!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1041;You now have a sand sailer frame, how you acquired it isn't important but how will you install it, is. You can get some professionals through the race club to do it for you for a small fee, or try it yourself...;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1041;I'll hire the help.;
prof_help;Hire help for 25 gold and don't risk the chance of failure.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1041;I'll do it myself!;
dyi;You'll replace the wood frame by yourself, this could possibly end in a horrendous failure.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1041;Wait... I know exactly what to do!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1042;After what feels like forever, you've finally finished replacing the frame... and it looks glorious. Now, the only thing left to do it test it out!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1042;Time to see what I can do!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1043;The helpful professionals you hired to replace the frame are finished, and your sailer looks great! Now, the only thing left to do it test it out!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1043;Time to see what I can do!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1044;Known amongst the sand sailers as "The Gauntlet" here in the northwest of the Si Wong Desert, the land changes from flat shifting dunes to canyons and spires of rock reaching to the sky in one fell stretch. The different conditions will certainly put you and your sailer to the test.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1044;Let's begin.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1045;Before you lies a tucked away, yet winding and potentially challenging canyon. A balanced test, you can push yourself for fame or work on fundamentals and not risk anything.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1045;I'll try some new moves...;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1045;I'll stick to the basics...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1046;Before you lies an expansive stretch of sand. With nothing but a heat haze on the horizion and the scorching sun overhead, this can be a great place to test your speed or your endurance.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1046;Let's see how fast I can go!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1046;Endurance is the key.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1047;Ahead of you lies pillars of rocks that stretch upwards to the blue, cloudless skies of the Si Wong Desert. They are very dense in the center, and have more separation between them towards the outer edges of this region.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1047;Into the center!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1047;The outside pass poses some challenges as well...;
EVTDESC_CASE1_SANDR.1048;You've made your way through the canyon and you still remain in one piece, onto the next challenge...;
EVTDESC_CASE2_SANDR.1048;After blazing across the hot golden sands, your next challenge comes into view...;
EVTDESC_CASE3_SANDR.1048;After navigating your way through the rock spire patch, you see your next challenge...;
EVTDESC_CASE4_SANDR.1048;You've completed all the challenges of the Gauntlet! You'll be the talk of the club until someone new makes it through.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1048;What's next?;
EVTOPTA_CASE1_SANDR.1048;Time for one final look over.;
expensive_frame_a;Purchase an expensive wood frame for §Y100§! gold.;
pricey_frame_a;Purchase an average wood frame for §Y50§! gold.;
cheapest_frame_a;Purchase a cheap wood frame for §Y25§! gold.;
go_back;Go back.;
expensive_frame_b;Have the thugs steal an expensive wood frame for §Y100§! prestige. Don't ask how they will get the job done, they always find a way. Also, there is a §R85§! percent chance your relationship with the trader will sour.;
pricey_frame_b;Have the thugs steal an average wood frame for §Y50§! prestige. §R50§! percent chance of a negative opinion from the trader.;
cheapest_frame_b;Have the thugs steal a cheap wood frame for §Y25§! prestige. Seriously, a cheap frame!?! This is someone's livelihood. Perhaps you could reconsider? No? Fine.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1049;After completing the three previous challenges you decide your new wood frame will work just fine for the races and practices ahead, at least for some time. Consider this quest done!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1049;Finally!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1054;Instead of going to the hustle and bustle of Misty Palms, you decide to vist the marketplace of one of the tribal villages you own. Who knows, you might find a bargain!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1054;Purchase an average frame.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1054;Purchase a below average frame.;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1054;Purchase a... Pai Sho piece?;
pai_sho?;You cannot even begin to fathom why this vendor is selling one singular Pai Sho piece. It seems only benefical if there was someone out there missing this particular piece. You'll still have to buy a frame.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1055;Everything was seeming so good until in an instant your sailer deconstructs itself right from underneath you. You live, you cannot say the same for your trusty sailer...;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1055;How am I going to replace the ENTIRE sailer!?!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1056;You decide to replace the rope rigging of your sailer. You were recently informed that a caravan was sent out into the desert with various materials, perhaps they have some rope?;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1056;I hope I can catch up to them!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1057;You have been cruising along the shifting sand dunes searching for the caravan for a few days, to no avail. Just before you turn back to wherever you call home and call off the search, you spot something just on the horizon, distorted by the crushing heat.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1057;It must be the caravan!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1058;It is the caravan! And they are all in one piece. As you pull up along side them the assumed leader calls out to you and wishes to know your business. You inform him you require replacement rope for your sailer and gesture to the frayed and tearing rope that is currently installed. The caravan leader, unaware that you are a [Root.GetTitle], says that he has plenty of rope can will sell it to you or give it you for free if you ride with them to their destination as a bender-for-hire.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1058;Buy the rope.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1058;Tag along for the ride.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1059;You think it'll be best to buy the rope and part ways, but you can change your mind and help your fellow tribals if you wish.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1059;Purchase the rope.;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1059;Go back.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1060;The exchange of money and goods is completed, and you and the caravan thank each other and part ways. On the ride back you can't help but wonder if they will make it to their destination, or will they meet a cruel fate at the hands of raiders.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1060;I'm sure they will be fine, right?;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1061;You agree to tag along and defend against any threats the caravan may face. Perhaps not the smartest decision a [Root.GetTitle] should be taking, but the people of this caravan are your subjects after all.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1061;Onwards.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1063;After a week, the caravan makes it to their destination. The leader thanks you and gives you enough rope to replace yours. You exchange goodbyes and climb aboard your sailer, preparing to set off back to home.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1063;What a journey!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1064;The first few days of the journey seemed uneventful, but on the dawn of the fifth day, sailers approach on the horizion and with them, raiders. Before you know it both parties dismount and begin battle. The raiders are disorganized and untrained and the upper hand seems to be yours, but before the day is won you find a raider charging you down!;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1064;Charge back at them!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1064;They charge like an amateur!;
EVTOPTC_SANDR.1064;Let them make the first move after the charge.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1065;The raider keeps charging, catching you off guard. You attempt spin out of it and their spear just cuts you. You are hurt, but still up.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1065;Attack!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1066;Instead of finishing the charge, the raider stops and waits for you. You have them right where you want them.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1066;Take this!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1067;The raider absorbs your attack but loses their weapon in the process. They charge at you and tackle you hard into the sand. Before a strike can be thrown a caravan member pulls the raider off of you and disposes of them outside of your field of vision.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1067;Thank [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1068;The carnage subsides and the raiders are no more. The caravan suffers no losses and quickly decides it is time to move on.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1068;This will be quite a tale for the courtiers back home!;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1068;One day the desert will be free of raider scum.;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1069;The caravan reaches it's destination and thanks you for your help. The rope is handed over along with some extra gold and you begin the journey home.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1069;A journey for the ages!;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1070;The search for the caravan is taking longer than you'd hoped for. But your spirit remains resolute, and you continue the search.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1070;They have to be out here somewhere...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1071;The search is taking much longer than you'd hoped for, and you begin to worry about running into a raider band out here in the desert, all alone. You take one last look around and see something you missed before way off in the distance.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1071;What is that?;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1072;As you approach closer, the sad reality sets in. The caravan was attacked by raiders, mostly looted and left to be buried under the sand. Most of the caravan is already partially buried, and you notice one crate untouched by the raiders. Inside it is rope, you take it before anyone else can.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1072;If only I was quicker...;
EVTOPTB_SANDR.1072;This will way heavy on my mind...;
EVTDESC_SANDR.1033;I heard about your wild adventure, [Root.GetFirstName]! Here's to hoping you got what you desired from it.;
EVTOPTA_SANDR.1033;Time to practice my knots...;
